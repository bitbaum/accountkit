# AccountKit agent instructions

## Org rules

Read `bitbaum/fleet` `AGENTS.md`, `SHARED.md` and the registers it names before
inventing a host, a name, a page or a shared behaviour. Do not copy their facts
into this file.

- **Packages first.** If a `@bitbaum/*` package (or `bip-kit`, `limitkit`,
  `threadkit`, `ai-forms`) already does it, use it and fix a defect in the
  package, not in this app. Every chat is `@bitbaum/chatkit`, every search box
  `@bitbaum/searchkit`, every chart `@bitbaum/chartkit`, accounts
  `@bitbaum/accountkit`, model calls `@bitbaum/ai-kit`. Review this product's
  `package-plan.json` before building anything.
- **One shape per kind.** Things of the same kind look the same and sit in the
  same place (fleet `AGENTS.md`, "One shape per kind").
- **Finished work ships by itself.** Open a non-draft pull request; the fleet
  auto-merge sweep is the only merge path. Never merge by hand, through the
  merge API, with `--auto` or with an admin bypass, and never force-push a
  shared branch.
- **Nothing made up.** A fact on a page or in a doc needs a source that was
  opened; where there is none, the line is removed or softened.
- **Bitcoin orange is for Bitcoin and top-of-funnel actions only.**
- **No model identifier** in anything pushed to a repository.
- Before you finish, run `node <fleet>/scripts/ci/docs-truth-audit.mjs --dir .`:
  the same check the sweep runs on every pull request.

This repository owns shared account and authentication behavior for Bitbaum
products. When a consumer finds a common lifecycle, recovery, identity-linking,
session, mail-adapter, screen or schema defect, fix it here, add the regression
test, release the package through the verified path, and then update consumers.
Do not patch the same shared behavior in app repositories.

Consumer-specific roles, tenant policy, legacy actor mappings, provider
configuration and data migrations remain owned by each product. Preserve their
contracts and prove migration parity; do not infer identity from email or
silently alter account ownership.

Read the README and existing tests before changing a public contract. Run
`pnpm run verify`. Authentication changes must retain real database lifecycle
coverage and consumer/browser journey coverage where the affected integration
is exercised. Do not move or rewrite published tags.
